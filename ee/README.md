## Development

Enterprise features are built on top of the core platform. They should:

1. Be modular and optional
2. Not break core functionality when disabled
3. Follow the same code quality standards
4. Include comprehensive tests
5. Have clear documentation

## Getting Started

Enterprise features will be documented here as they are developed.
For now, this directory serves as a placeholder for future commercial offerings.
